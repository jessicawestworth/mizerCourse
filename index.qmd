# Online course

In this hands-on online course you will learn about the principles of size based multi-species fisheries modelling and the implementation of these principles in the R package mizer. You will build a mizer model for the Celtic sea from scratch and will also be encouraged to build a model for your own area of interest. You will then run various scenarios to explore how the ecosystem reacts to changes in fishing or other stressors.

The course material was adapted from two previous three-week courses in [August 2022](https://mizer.course.aug22.sizespectrum.org) and in [November 2022](https://mizer.course.nov22.sizespectrum.org/).

## Introduction to the mizer framework

Size spectrum modelling aims to characterize the distribution of organisms across different size classes within an ecosystem to better understand its structure and dynamics. Body size is a fundamental biological trait, as it influences key life processes such as metabolism, growth, reproduction and mortality. It also plays a central role in ecological interactions, particularly predation.

In predator-prey relationships, an organismsâ€™ body size largely determines both the potential prey an organism can consume and the predators it is consumed by. This size-based structure underpins many of the emergent patterns seen in food webs and energy transfer within ecosystems.

Mizer is a modelling framework that leverages these principles to simulate marine ecosystems. It uses size spectrum theory to represent populations and communities as well as observational data to calibrate various species traits. Attempting to reproduce ecosystem dynamics, structure, and functioning within a dynamic model. Through this mizer can explore how changes in fishing pressure, resource availability, and species traits affect ecosystem functioning and resilience. Therefore, allowing the prediction of potential consequences of anthropogenic influences and ecological changes.

## Tutorials

The course has three parts, each consisting of several tutorials.

-   **[Part 1: Understand](understand/index.qmd)**\
    You will gain an understanding of size spectra and their dynamics by exploring simple example systems hands-on with mizer.

-   **[Part 2: Build](build/index.qmd)**\
    You will build your own multi-species mizer model for the Celtic sea, following our example. You can also create a model for your own area of interest.

-   **[Part 3: Use](use/index.qmd)**\
    You will explore the effects of changes in fishing and changes in resource dynamics on the fish community and the fisheries yield. You will run your own model scenarios.

There are exercises dotted throughout the tutorials.

To get started, [install the tools](prepare/install-tools.qmd) you need and then go to [Part 1](understand/index.qmd) to learn about size spectra and their dynamics.
